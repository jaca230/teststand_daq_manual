## Differential Signals

Differential signals offer several advantages over single-ended signals:

- **More resistant to noise**: Differential signaling reduces susceptibility to noise interference, resulting in cleaner signal transmission.
- **Lower supply voltages**: Differential signaling allows for the use of lower supply voltages (like Low Voltage CMOS (LVCMOS) at 3.0–3.3V), which can lead to reduced power consumption.
- **Higher operating frequencies**: Due to better noise immunity and lower voltage swings, differential signals enable higher operating frequencies in electronic circuits.
