## Setting Up a GitHub SSH Token on RHEL7/9 Systems

### 1. Generate an SSH Key Pair

1. Open your terminal.
2. Generate a new SSH key. Replace `your_email@example.com` with the email address associated with your GitHub account.

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

    If you are using an older system that doesnâ€™t support the `ed25519` algorithm, you can use `rsa` instead:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to save the key in the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and set a passphrase.

### 2. Add the SSH Key to the SSH-Agent

1. Start the SSH agent in the background:

    ```
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
    ```

2. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. Replace `id_ed25519` with the name of your private key file if you used a different name.

    ```
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    ```

### 3. Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

1. Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

    ```
    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    ```
    This will display for the key. Copy all of it.

2. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys** > **New SSH key**.
3. Paste your SSH key into the "Key" field and add a descriptive title.
4. Click "Add SSH key".

### 4. Test Your SSH Connection

1. Test the connection to make sure everything is set up correctly:

    ```
    ssh -T git@github.com
    ```

2. You should see a message like:

    ```
    Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
    ```
### Example Steps in Terminal

```
# Step 1: Generate an SSH Key Pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Step 2: Start the SSH agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Step 3: Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Step 4: Copy the SSH key to your clipboard
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Step 5: Add the SSH key to GitHub via the GitHub web interface

# Step 6: Test your SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## ROOT

### Overview

[ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) is an open-source data analysis framework developed by CERN. It is widely used in high-energy physics for data processing, statistical analysis, visualization, and storage. It is needed for some features of Midas.

### Installation Guide
General installaiton guides are provided by ROOT at their [Installing ROOT](https://root.cern/install/) and [Building ROOT from source](https://root.cern/install/build_from_source/) pages.

#### AlmaLinux 9

1 **Enable the EPEL repository**:

```
sudo yum install epel-release
```

2 **Download and Install ROOT**:

```
sudo yum install root
```

#### Building from source (Linux)

1 **Example building latest stable branch from source**

```
git clone --branch latest-stable --depth=1 https://github.com/root-project/root.git root_src
mkdir root_build root_install && cd root_build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../root_install ../root_src # && check cmake configuration output for warnings or errors
cmake --build . -- install -j4 # if you have 4 cores available for compilation
source ../root_install/bin/thisroot.sh # or thisroot.{fish,csh}
```

**Note**: Adjust the ROOT version and the download URL as needed. Always check for the latest version on the [official ROOT website](https://root.cern.ch/). Furthermore, if you are not building from source you are installing precompiled binaries, which may not be up to date versions of ROOT. For specific versions, you may need to build root from source.

## Midas

### Overview

[Midas](https://daq00.triumf.ca/MidasWiki/index.php/Main_Page) is a data acquisition system used in high-energy physics experiments.
Midas provides the following functionalities:

- Run control
- Experiment configuration
- Data readout
- Event building
- Data storage
- Slow control
- Alarm systems
- ... much more ...

### Installation Guide

For a general Midas installation, you can follow this [Linux Quick Start Guide](https://daq00.triumf.ca/MidasWiki/index.php/Quickstart_Linux). For the g-2 modified DAQ, we use a custom version of midas, which can be cloned and installed as follows:

1 **Set experiment name environment variable**

```
export MIDAS_EXPT_NAME=DAQ
```
2 **Create exptab file**

```
mkdir online
cd online
touch exptab
echo "$MIDAS_EXPT_NAME $(pwd) system" >> exptab
export MIDAS_EXPTAB=$(pwd)/exptab	
```
3 **Install Midas**

```
cd ..
mkdir packages
git clone --recursive git@github.com:PIONEER-Experiment/midas-modified.git midas
cd midas
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc) install
cd ..
```

4 **Set `MIDASSYS` environment variable and add to path**

```
export MIDASSYS=$(pwd)
export PATH=$PATH:$MIDASSYS/bin
```
**Note**: you can hardcode the environment variables `MIDASSYS` (and add to path), `MIDAS_EXPTAB`, and `MIDAS_EXPT_NAME` by adding the appropriate commands to your .bashrc file. This way, the environment variables are set with each new terminal session for that user.

## Meinberg

### Overview

[Meinberg](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/) provides a range of synchronization solutions, including Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, precision time protocol (PTP) solutions, and GPS radio clocks. These tools are essential for accurate time synchronization in various high-precision applications.

In our case, we use it to apply a GPS timestamp to each event. In reality, this is an artifact from g-2 where seperate systems needed to be time correlated. Only the "GPS" master trigger mode needs the meinberg.

### Installation Guide

For more general information about Meinberg devices, see Meinberg's [Installing the Software](https://kb.meinbergglobal.com/) page.

#### AlmaLinux 9

1 **Clone the repository**:

```
git clone https://git.meinbergglobal.com/drivers/mbgtools-lx.git
cd mbgtools-lx
git pull
```
**Note**: Ensure that the URLs and repository paths are correct.

2 **Compile the source code**:

```
make clean
make
```

**Note**: You may need to use a development kernel. This command will install the development kernel for your current kernel version.

```
sudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) gcc make
```

3 **Install the software**:

```
sudo make install
sudo /sbin/modprobe mbgclock
make install_svc
```

4 **Verify installation**

```
mbgstatus
```

The output of this command should look similar to this:
```
